# Formatics

An app where you can find all formulas of Mathematics & Physics
You can also find solutions of many mathematical problems in this app

# Motivation 
There are many apps available in the play store that does almost the same work, but none of those has a good interface and I had to use two or three different apps to use their different functionality. So I decided to create this app where you will get many funtionalities in one place.
